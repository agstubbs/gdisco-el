* gdisco-el
Nascent emacs lisp bindings for Google's various APIs (using the Discovery API)
* Motivation
- Learning Emacs LISP
- Provide a mechanism for interfacing with some interesting Google Services
  - GMail
  - Google Drive
  - Google Sheets
- Provide just enough functioanlity to be useful learning other Emacs features and LISP techniques in general
* Limitations
- Really just a dynamic porcelain on top of the published Google APIs
  - Completely unoptimised
  - Missing lots of functionality, batch calls and anything using these methods:
    - DELETE
    - POST
    - PATCH
    - PUT
- Written by somebody who has never written any LISP before!
- No checking:
  - no parameter checking
  - no checking results
  - no error handling
- No mapping results to declared schema objects
- API likely to be unstable
